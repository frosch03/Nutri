Nutri
==========

Nutri is a very basic library to calculate a little with macro
nutrient's. 


Foods
----------

There are some food's included in `VariousFoods.hs` and more can be
defined there. A Food is basically a function that takes an amount
value and calculates from that the caloric value.


Weight
----------

The amount of food is given by the Weight type. Until now, there are
only `Gramm` values, but more can be added to that type.


Macros
----------

The `Macros` type is a triple type, that contains the macro
nutrients. Those are *Protein*, *Carbohydrate*s and *Fat*s.
